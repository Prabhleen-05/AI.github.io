What is artificial intelligence ?<br><br>
Artificial intelligence = artificial + intelligence<br><br>

Artificial = Not Natural<br><br>

Intelligence = The capacity to learn and solve problems<br><br>

Artificial Intelligence : Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.<br><br>
The ability to solve problems.<br>
The ability to act rationally.<br>
The ability to act like humans<br>

<center><h1><u>EVOLUTION OF AI</u></h1></center>


<p style="font-size:30px ; font-family:monotype corsiva "> 
There are diffrent <u>stages in the evolution of artificial intelligence</u> some stages are mentioned below:<br><br>
1) Maturation of Artificial Intelligence (1943-1952)<br>
2) The birth of Artificial Intelligence (1952-1956)<br>
3) The golden years-Early enthusiasm (1956-1974)<br>
4) The first AI winter (1974-1980)<br>
5) The emergence of intelligent agents (1993-2011)<br>
6) Deep learning, big data and artificial general intelligence (2011-present)<br>
The same is shown by a pictorial representation below:<br<br></p>

<center><h1><u>APPLICATIONS</u></h1></center>

<p style="font-size:30px ; font-family:monotype corsiva "> 
In this new era of internet revolution we need not to wait for too long to experience AI. Wether we know what is AI or not<br>
but we are interacting with it in our daily life for example the voice commands which we give to our google assistant<br>
or apple's siri this comes in the branch of AI known as natural language processing. Some other applications of AI are shown in the diagram below.<br><br>

<center><h1><u>PROS AND CONS OF AI</u></h1></center>

<p style="font-size:30px ; font-family:monotype corsiva "> 
As we all know that every coin has two sides the same applies to AI also till now we have only seen<br>
the applications and advantages of AI but it has some drawbacks aslo this has been shown by the image below:<br><br>

<center><h1><u>BRANCHES OF AI</u></h1></center>

<p style="font-size:30px ; font-family:monotype corsiva ">
There is a broad set of techniques that come in the domain of artificial intelligence such as linguistics, bias, vision<br> 
planning, robotic process automation, natural language processing, decision science, etc. Some branches are <br>
shown below by the diagram<br><br>

<center><h1><u>DIFFRENT PERSPECTIVES ON AI</u></h1></center>

<p style="font-size:30px ; font-family:monotype corsiva ">

“The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race….It would take off on its own,<br>
 and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete,<br>
 and would be superseded.”<br>

<u>Stephen Hawking</u><br><br>

"AI doesn’t have to be evil to destroy humanity – if AI has a goal and humanity just happens to come in the way,<br>
 it will destroy humanity as a matter of course without even thinking about it, no hard feelings.”<br>

<u>Elon Musk</u><br><br>

“Robots are not going to replace humans, they are going to make their jobs much more humane.<br>
 Difficult, demeaning, demanding, dangerous, dull – these are the jobs robots will be taking.”<br>

<u>Sabine Hauert, Co-founder of Robohub.org</u><br>
